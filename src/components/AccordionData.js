    question: "Do you design the website too, or just develop it?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I handle both! I’ll work with you to design the layout, colors, and overall look of the site, and then build it so it works smoothly across devices. You don’t need to bring a separate designer unless you already have someone or want a more detailed brand package.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to provide the text and images?",
    answer:
      "If you already have content, great — I’ll help you organize and present it. If not, I can guide you through what’s needed and help source stock imagery or suggest a copywriting structure. For custom packages, I can assist more hands-on with writing and sourcing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are revisions included?",
    answer:
      "Yes, but they vary by package. The Starter package includes 1 round of feedback to keep things fast and budget-friendly. Professional and Custom packages include more flexibility and rounds of revision.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help me choose where to build my site?",
    answer:
      "Definitely. I’ll help you choose the right platform based on your goals, budget, and how hands-on you want to be with future updates (e.g., Webflow, WordPress, Framer, or custom code).",
